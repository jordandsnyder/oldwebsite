There are several great reads out there:  
  * Credits to [Steven Miller](http://svmiller.com/), whose website formed the foundation for my own.  His blog is also worth checking out! You can find the template for his website (and this one) [here](https://github.com/svmiller/steve-ngvb-jekyll-template)
  
  * Eric Metaxas' [Boenhoeffer](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B003GY0K48/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&btkr=1)
  
  * To learn R from a humorous psychologist, check out [Discovering Statistics Using R](https://uk.sagepub.com/en-gb/eur/discovering-statistics-using-r/book236067)
  
  * A great [read](https://www.amazon.com/Building-Peace-Sustainable-Reconciliation-Societies/dp/1878379739/ref=sr_1_3?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1532570588&sr=1-3&keywords=lederach) on Conflict Transformation is by John Paul Lederach
  
  * The [Treatments that Work Series](http://www.oxfordclinicalpsych.com/page/ttwseries/ttwseries) by Oxford Press has a good starting point for empirically-supported treatments for clinical concerns.

## Programming/Stats ##

I am increasing interested in learning R as a way to help answer questions that communities and organizations have in their unique contexts. Ultimately, I ended up conducting my own dissertation in R to further learn more about programming. I am increasing interested in other tools that will equip me to help communities and organizations, including learning more about R, Python, and programming and statistics in general.

A shout out to #rstats on twitter. A very helpful community!

Hello All!

I am moving to Anchorage, Alaska! As such, I am driving to Anchorage from the lower 48.

Below is a general map of my route:

I really have not done the best job at doing photography, but will continue to try to!

Part way through my scenic journey in Saskatchewan, a bee joined me for part of the trip. The bee stayed with me for over an hour! Eventually, he flew out the window, but he may have been a bit far from home!

Finally, I was able to settle in and get some good food at my next stop.

Around 1800 miles left to travel to Anchorage!

I am a strong believer in Open Science.  What do I mean by this? Ultimately, science should be open, transparent, and reproducible.  If science is conducted in this way, I believe it is better for scientists and those with whom we work. I will have more on this later, but please check out some of these great sites:

* [Center for Open Science](https://cos.io/)

* [Society for the Improvement of Psychological Science](https://improvingpsych.org/)

One of my first mentors in graduate school told me in regards to collaborators to work with people whom I would enjoy eating dinner and being friends with and whose mission I believe in.  I have found this to be one of the most important pieces of advice I have received. I have counted it a great privilege to work with some great people. I hope this continues in the future and that I can work with other great people doing great work!

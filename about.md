I have completed my doctoral degree in clinical psychology from Wheaton College (IL). I completed my clinical internship at the Alaska VA in Anchorage. I am completing my post-doctoral fellowship in psychosocial recovery oriented services at the San Diego VA Healthcare System / University of California, San Diego. 

My research interests include global mental health, attitudes towards others and society (e.g., peace and reconciliation), and community-based work with conflict-affected populations.  Most of my work has been conducted in Rwanda and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. I am continuing work with a terrific project called [Working Alongside Refugees in Mental Health (WARM).](https://www.warmalaska.org/)

Outside of my academic pursuits, I enjoy outdoor activities, programming and coding, and cooking.
